                    <p class="p-white">I am a student attending California State University, Fresno (Fresno State). I am currently in my third year at Fresno State, graudating in Spring of 2021. I am majoring in Business Administration with an emphasis in Information Systems (IS). Some of my favorite topics I like are programming, cybersecurity and management. </p>
                    <p class="p-white">Some of my hobbies are learning new things, hanging out with friends, digital art and watching interesting shows. My favorite shows right now are The Expanse and Witcher. My two go-to caf√© shops are Starbucks and Teazers. I love dogs, mostly German Shepards. I have two German Shepards, Lucky Jr. and Duke (Pictures of them are below).</p>
